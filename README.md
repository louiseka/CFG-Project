# Dish Diaries

## What is Dish Diaries?

Dish Diaries was a solo project that was created as a final presentation piece for Code First Girls Coding Kickstarter Web Development course.

Dish Diaries is an accessible alternative to those keyword and ad stuffed recipe websites that we have all experienced. The website include Desserts, Lunch, and Dinner recipes. 

## Technologies used

For this project it was required that I used the following languages and frameworks: 

- HTML 
- CSS
- Bootstrap 
- JavaScript 

## Implementations for future

- The ability to add recipes to a favourites list which would be saved in the user's local storage.
- Reviews would be saved to local storage. 
- The submit your recipes form would send data to Firebase.
